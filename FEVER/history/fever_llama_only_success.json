The current rise in global average temperature is more rapid than previous changes, and is primarily caused by humans burning fossil fuels.[2][3] Fossil fuel use, deforestation, and some agricultural and industrial practices increase greenhouse gases, notably carbon dioxide and methane.[4] Greenhouse gases absorb some of the heat that the Earth radiates after it warms from sunlight. Larger amounts of these gases trap more heat in Earth's lower atmosphere, causing global warming.. Due to climate change, deserts are expanding, while heat waves and wildfires are becoming more common.[5] Increased warming in the Arctic has contributed to melting permafrost, glacial retreat and sea ice loss.[6] Higher temperatures are also causing more intense storms, droughts, and other weather extremes.[7] Rapid environmental change in mountains, coral reefs, and the Arctic is forcing many species to relocate or become extinct.[8] Even if efforts to minimise future warming are successful, some effects will continue for centuries.\nThought 2: The observation says that it is expected to shrink glaciers, so it is true.\nAction 2: Finish[SUPPORTS]\nObservation 2: Episode finished"}, {"instruction": "Claim: Edgar Wright is from England.\n", "input": "", "output": "Thought 1: I need to search Edgar Wright and find if he is from England.\nAction 1: Search[Edgar Wright]\nObservation 1: Edgar Howard Wright (born 18 April 1974) is an English filmmaker.

The genre was influential in Britain in shaping politics, national policies, and popular perceptions in the years leading up to the First World War, and remains a part of popular culture to this day.
