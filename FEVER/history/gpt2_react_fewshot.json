It is the largest ancient amphitheatre ever built, and is still the largest standing amphitheatre in the world, despite its age.

Climate change in a broader sense also includes previous long-term changes to Earth's climate. The current rise in global average temperature is more rapid than previous changes, and is primarily caused by humans burning fossil fuels.[2][3] Fossil fuel use, deforestation, and some agricultural and industrial practices increase greenhouse gases, notably carbon dioxide and methane.[4] Greenhouse gases absorb some of the heat that the Earth radiates after it warms from sunlight. Larger amounts of these gases trap more heat in Earth's lower atmosphere, causing global warming.. Due to climate change, deserts are expanding, while heat waves and wildfires are becoming more common.[5] Increased warming in the Arctic has contributed to melting permafrost, glacial retreat and sea ice loss.[6] Higher temperatures are also causing more intense storms, droughts, and other weather extremes.[7] Rapid environmental change in mountains, coral reefs, and the Arctic is forcing many species to relocate or become extinct.[8] Even if efforts to minimise future warming are successful, some effects will continue for centuries.\nThought 3: The Earth is warming, but not fast enough to cause catastrophic changes.\nAction 3: The Earth is warming, but not fast enough to cause catastrophic changes.\nObservation 3: Invalid action: the Earth is warming, but not fast enough to cause catastrophic changes.\nThought 4: The Earth is warming, but not fast enough to cause catastrophic changes.\nAction 4: The Earth is warming, but not fast enough to cause catastrophic changes.\nObservation 4: Invalid action: the Earth is warming, but not fast enough to cause catastrophic changes.\nThought 5: The Earth is warming, but not fast enough to cause catastrophic changes.\nAction 5: The Earth is warming, but not fast enough to cause catastrophic changes.\nObservation 5: Invalid action: the Earth is warming, but not fast enough to cause catastrophic changes.\nThought 6: The Earth is warming, but not fast enough to cause catastrophic changes.\nAction 6: The Earth is warming, but not fast enough to cause catastrophic changes.\nObservation 6: Invalid action: the Earth is warming, but not fast enough to cause catastrophic changes.\nThought 7: The Earth is warming, but not fast enough to cause catastrophic changes.\nAction 7: The Earth is warming, but not fast enough to cause catastrophic changes.\nObservation 7: Invalid action: the Earth is warming, but not fast enough to cause catastrophic changes.\n", "\nDetermine if there is Observation that SUPPORTS or REFUTES a Claim, or if there is NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION. \nClaim: Nikolaj Coster-Waldau worked with the Fox Broadcasting Company.\nThought 1: I need to search Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and find if he has worked with the Fox Broadcasting Company.\nAction 1: Search[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]\nObservation 1: Nikolaj William Coster-Waldau (born 27 July 1970) is a Danish actor and producer.

Most cases of ALS (about 90% to 95%) have no known cause, and are known as sporadic ALS.[3][11] However, both genetic and environmental factors are believed to be involved.[12] The remaining 5% to 10% of cases have a genetic cause, often linked to a history of the disease in the family, and these are known as genetic ALS.[11][13] About half of these genetic cases are due to one of two specific genes.[3] The diagnosis is based on a person's signs and symptoms, with testing done to rule out other potential causes.[3]. There is no known cure for ALS.[3] The goal of treatment is to slow the disease and improve symptoms.[10] Treatments that slow ALS include riluzole (extends life by two to three months[14]) and sodium phenylbutyrate/ursodoxicoltaurine (extends life by around seven months[15]). Non-invasive ventilation may result in both improved quality and length of life.[5] Mechanical ventilation can prolong survival but does not stop disease progression.[16] A feeding tube may help maintain weight and nutrition.[17] Death is usually caused by respiratory failure.[13] The disease can affect people of any age, but usually starts around the age of 60.[13] The average survival from onset to death is two to four years, though this can vary, and about 10% survive longer than ten years.[18]. Descriptions of the disease date back to at least 1824 by Charles Bell.[19] In 1869, the connection between the symptoms and the underlying neurological problems was first described by French neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot, who in 1874 began using the term amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.[19].\nThought 3: ALS is a degenerative disease\nAction 3: ALS is a degenerative disease\nObservation 3: Invalid action: aLS is a degenerative disease\nThought 4: ALS is a degenerative disease\nAction 4: ALS is a degenerative disease\nObservation 4: Invalid action: aLS is a degenerative disease\nThought 5: ALS is a degenerative disease\nAction 5: ALS is a degenerative disease\nObservation 5: Invalid action: aLS is a degenerative disease\nThought 6: ALS is a degenerative disease\nAction 6: ALS is a degenerative disease\nObservation 6: Invalid action: aLS is a degenerative disease\nThought 7: ALS is a degenerative disease\nAction 7: ALS is a degenerative disease\nObservation 7: Invalid action: aLS is a degenerative disease\n", "\nDetermine if there is Observation that SUPPORTS or REFUTES a Claim, or if there is NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION. \nClaim: Nikolaj Coster-Waldau worked with the Fox Broadcasting Company.\nThought 1: I need to search Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and find if he has worked with the Fox Broadcasting Company.\nAction 1: Search[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]\nObservation 1: Nikolaj William Coster-Waldau (born 27 July 1970) is a Danish actor and producer.

The first individuals to identify themselves as atheists lived in the 18th century during the Age of Enlightenment.[17][18] The French Revolution, noted for its \"unprecedented atheism\", witnessed the first significant political movement in history to advocate for the supremacy of human reason.[19] In 1967, Albania declared itself the first official atheist country according to its policy of state Marxism.[20]. Arguments for atheism range from philosophical to social and historical approaches. Rationales for not believing in deities include the lack of evidence,[21][22] the problem of evil, the argument from inconsistent revelations, the rejection of concepts that cannot be falsified, and the argument from nonbelief.[21][23] Nonbelievers contend that atheism is a more parsimonious position than theism and that everyone is born without beliefs in deities;[5] therefore, they argue that the burden of proof lies not on the atheist to disprove the existence of gods but on the theist to provide a rationale for theism.[24] Although some atheists have adopted secular philosophies (e.g. secular humanism),[25][26] there is no ideology or code of conduct to which all atheists adhere.[27].\nThought 4: Theism and Atheism\nAction 4: Theism and Atheism\nObservation 4: Invalid action: theism and Atheism\nThought 5: Theism and Atheism\nAction 5: Theism and Atheism\nObservation 5: Invalid action: theism and Atheism\nThought 6: Theism and Atheism\nAction 6: Theism and Atheism\nObservation 6: Invalid action: theism and Atheism\nThought 7: Theism and Atheism\nAction 7: Theism and Atheism\nObservation 7: Invalid action: theism and Atheism\n", "\nDetermine if there is Observation that SUPPORTS or REFUTES a Claim, or if there is NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION. \nClaim: Nikolaj Coster-Waldau worked with the Fox Broadcasting Company.\nThought 1: I need to search Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and find if he has worked with the Fox Broadcasting Company.\nAction 1: Search[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]\nObservation 1: Nikolaj William Coster-Waldau (born 27 July 1970) is a Danish actor and producer.

Due to the broad definition of a hormone (as a signaling molecule that exerts its effects far from its site of production), numerous kinds of molecules can be classified as hormones. Among the substances that can be considered hormones, are eicosanoids (e.g. prostaglandins and thromboxanes), steroids (e.g. oestrogen and brassinosteroid), amino acid derivatives (e.g.\nThought 4: I searched for \"estrogen\" and \"estrogen Hormone\" to find the song.\nAction 4: Search[estrogen]\nObservation 4: Estrogen or oestrogen (see spelling differences) is a category of sex hormone responsible for the development and regulation of the female reproductive system and secondary sex characteristics.[1][2] There are three major endogenous estrogens that have estrogenic hormonal activity: estrone (E1), estradiol (E2), and estriol (E3).[1][3] Estradiol, an estrane, is the most potent and prevalent.[1] Another estrogen called estetrol (E4) is produced only during pregnancy.. Estrogens are synthesized in all vertebrates[4] and some insects.[5] Their presence in both vertebrates and insects suggests that estrogenic sex hormones have an ancient evolutionary history. Quantitatively, estrogens circulate at lower levels than androgens in both men and women.[6] While estrogen levels are significantly lower in males than in females, estrogens nevertheless have important physiological roles in males.[7]. Like all steroid hormones, estrogens readily diffuse across the cell membrane. Once inside the cell, they bind to and activate estrogen receptors (ERs) which in turn modulate the expression of many genes.[8] Additionally, estrogens bind to and activate rapid-signaling membrane estrogen receptors (mERs),[9][10] such as GPER (GPR30).[11].\nThought 5: Estrogenic hormones are not only produced in the ovaries, but also in the testes.\nAction 5: Estrogenic hormones are not only produced in the ovaries, but also in the testes.\nObservation 5: Invalid action: estrogenic hormones are not only produced in the ovaries, but also in the testes.\nThought 6: Estrogenic hormones are produced in the ovaries, but not in the testes.\nAction 6: Estrogenic hormones are produced in the ovaries, but not in the testes.\nObservation 6: Invalid action: estrogenic hormones are produced in the ovaries, but not in the testes.\nThought 7: Estrogenic hormones are produced in the ovaries, but not in the testes.\nAction 7: Estrogenic hormones are produced in the ovaries, but not in the testes.\nObservation 7: Invalid action: estrogenic hormones are produced in the ovaries, but not in the testes.\n", "\nDetermine if there is Observation that SUPPORTS or REFUTES a Claim, or if there is NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION. \nClaim: Nikolaj Coster-Waldau worked with the Fox Broadcasting Company.\nThought 1: I need to search Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and find if he has worked with the Fox Broadcasting Company.\nAction 1: Search[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]\nObservation 1: Nikolaj William Coster-Waldau (born 27 July 1970) is a Danish actor and producer.

A foundational force in the genre following the advent of the new wave of British heavy metal, Lemmy was known for his appearance, which included his signature friendly mutton chops, his military-influenced fashion sense and his gravelly rasp of a voice. It was once declared \"one of the most recognisable voices in rock\".[1] He was also noted for his unique way of singing, which was once described as \"looking up towards a towering microphone tilted down into his weather-beaten face\".[2] He was also known for his bass playing style and using his Rickenbacker bass to create an \"overpowered, distorted rhythmic rumble\".[2] Another notable aspect of his bass sound was that he often played power chords using heavily overdriven tube stacks by Marshall..

Their ethnonym is derived from the Angles, one of the Germanic peoples who migrated to Great Britain around the 5th century AD.[9]. The  English largely descend from two main historical population groups: the West Germanic tribes, including the Angles, Saxons, Jutes, and Frisians who settled in Southern Britain following the withdrawal of the Romans, and the partially Romanised Celtic Britons who already lived there.[10][11][12][13] Collectively known as the Anglo-Saxons, they founded what was to become the Kingdom of England by the early 10th century, in response to the invasion and extensive settlement of Danes that began in the late 9th century.[14][15] This was followed by the Norman Conquest and limited settlement of Normans in England in the later 11th century.[16][17][18][10][19] Some definitions of English people include, while others exclude, people descended from later migration into England.[20]. England is the largest and most populous country in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. In the Acts of Union 1707, the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland merged to become the Kingdom of Great Britain.[21] Over the years, English customs and identity have become fairly closely aligned with British customs and identity in general.\nThought 6: The English language is a language of the English people.\nAction 6: The English language is a language of the English people.\nObservation 6: Invalid action: the English language is a language of the English people.\nThought 7: The English language is a language of the English people.\nAction 7: The English language is a language of the English people.\nObservation 7: Invalid action: the English language is a language of the English people.\n", "\nDetermine if there is Observation that SUPPORTS or REFUTES a Claim, or if there is NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION. \nClaim: Nikolaj Coster-Waldau worked with the Fox Broadcasting Company.\nThought 1: I need to search Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and find if he has worked with the Fox Broadcasting Company.\nAction 1: Search[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]\nObservation 1: Nikolaj William Coster-Waldau (born 27 July 1970) is a Danish actor and producer.

Originating in Phoenix, Arizona, in 1964, \"Alice Cooper\" was originally a band with roots extending back to a band called the Earwigs, consisting of Furnier on lead vocals and harmonica, Glen Buxton on lead guitar, and Dennis Dunaway on bass guitar and backing vocals. By 1966, Michael Bruce on rhythm guitar joined the three and Neal Smith was added on drums in 1967. The five named the band \"Alice Cooper\", and Furnier eventually adopted it as his stage pseudonym.[5][6] They released their 1969 debut studio album with limited chart success.\nThought 3: The \"Alice Cooper\" Experience\nAction 3: The \"Alice Cooper\" Experience\nObservation 3: Invalid action: the \"Alice Cooper\" Experience\nThought 4: The \"Alice Cooper\" Experience\nAction 4: The \"Alice Cooper\" Experience\nObservation 4: Invalid action: the \"Alice Cooper\" Experience\nThought 5: The \"Alice Cooper\" Experience\nAction 5: The \"Alice Cooper\" Experience\nObservation 5: Invalid action: the \"Alice Cooper\" Experience\nThought 6: The \"Alice Cooper\" Experience\nAction 6: The \"Alice Cooper\" Experience\nObservation 6: Invalid action: the \"Alice Cooper\" Experience\nThought 7: The \"Alice Cooper\" Experience\nAction 7: The \"Alice Cooper\" Experience\nObservation 7: Invalid action: the \"Alice Cooper\" Experience\n", "\nDetermine if there is Observation that SUPPORTS or REFUTES a Claim, or if there is NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION. \nClaim: Nikolaj Coster-Waldau worked with the Fox Broadcasting Company.\nThought 1: I need to search Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and find if he has worked with the Fox Broadcasting Company.\nAction 1: Search[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]\nObservation 1: Nikolaj William Coster-Waldau (born 27 July 1970) is a Danish actor and producer.

Most cases of ALS (about 90% to 95%) have no known cause, and are known as sporadic ALS.[3][11] However, both genetic and environmental factors are believed to be involved.[12] The remaining 5% to 10% of cases have a genetic cause, often linked to a history of the disease in the family, and these are known as genetic ALS.[11][13] About half of these genetic cases are due to one of two specific genes.[3] The diagnosis is based on a person's signs and symptoms, with testing done to rule out other potential causes.[3]. There is no known cure for ALS.[3] The goal of treatment is to slow the disease and improve symptoms.[10] Treatments that slow ALS include riluzole (extends life by two to three months[14]) and sodium phenylbutyrate/ursodoxicoltaurine (extends life by around seven months[15]). Non-invasive ventilation may result in both improved quality and length of life.[5] Mechanical ventilation can prolong survival but does not stop disease progression.[16] A feeding tube may help maintain weight and nutrition.[17] Death is usually caused by respiratory failure.[13] The disease can affect people of any age, but usually starts around the age of 60.[13] The average survival from onset to death is two to four years, though this can vary, and about 10% survive longer than ten years.[18]. Descriptions of the disease date back to at least 1824 by Charles Bell.[19] In 1869, the connection between the symptoms and the underlying neurological problems was first described by French neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot, who in 1874 began using the term amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.[19].\nThought 3: ALS is a degenerative disease\nAction 3: ALS is a degenerative disease\nObservation 3: Invalid action: aLS is a degenerative disease\nThought 4: ALS is a degenerative disease\nAction 4: ALS is a degenerative disease\nObservation 4: Invalid action: aLS is a degenerative disease\nThought 5: ALS is a degenerative disease\nAction 5: ALS is a degenerative disease\nObservation 5: Invalid action: aLS is a degenerative disease\nThought 6: ALS is a degenerative disease\nAction 6: ALS is a degenerative disease\nObservation 6: Invalid action: aLS is a degenerative disease\nThought 7: ALS is a degenerative disease\nAction 7: ALS is a degenerative disease\nObservation 7: Invalid action: aLS is a degenerative disease\n", "\nDetermine if there is Observation that SUPPORTS or REFUTES a Claim, or if there is NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION. \nClaim: Nikolaj Coster-Waldau worked with the Fox Broadcasting Company.\nThought 1: I need to search Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and find if he has worked with the Fox Broadcasting Company.\nAction 1: Search[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]\nObservation 1: Nikolaj William Coster-Waldau (born 27 July 1970) is a Danish actor and producer.

While Frenchmen Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re are generally credited with the birth of modern cinema,[5] American cinema soon came to be a dominant force in the emerging industry. As of 2017[update], it produced the third-largest number of films of any national cinema, after India and China, with more than 600 English-language films released on average every year.[6] While the national cinemas of the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand also produce films in the same language, they are not part of the Hollywood system.

They are regarded as the most influential band of all time[1] and were integral to the development of 1960s counterculture and popular music's recognition as an art form.[2] Rooted in skiffle, beat and 1950s rock 'n' roll, their sound incorporated elements of classical music and traditional pop in innovative ways; the band also explored music styles ranging from folk and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock. As pioneers in recording, songwriting and artistic presentation, the Beatles revolutionised many aspects of the music industry and were often publicised as leaders of the era's youth and sociocultural movements.[3]. Led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, the Beatles evolved from Lennon's previous group, the Quarrymen, and built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over three years from 1960, initially with Stuart Sutcliffe playing bass. The core trio of Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, together since 1958, went through a succession of drummers, including Pete Best, before asking Starr to join them in 1962.\nThought 3: The Beatles were a group of musicians who were not only talented but also very creative.\nAction 3: The Beatles were a group of musicians who were not only talented but also very creative.\nObservation 3: Invalid action: the Beatles were a group of musicians who were not only talented but also very creative.\nThought 4: The Beatles were a group of musicians who were not only talented but also very creative.\nAction 4: The Beatles were a group of musicians who were not only talented but also very creative.\nObservation 4: Invalid action: the Beatles were a group of musicians who were not only talented but also very creative.\nThought 5: The Beatles were a group of musicians who were not only talented but also very creative.\nAction 5: The Beatles were a group of musicians who were not only talented but also very creative.\nObservation 5: Invalid action: the Beatles were a group of musicians who were not only talented but also very creative.\nThought 6: The Beatles were a group of musicians who were not only talented but also very creative.\nAction 6: The Beatles were a group of musicians who were not only talented but also very creative.\nObservation 6: Invalid action: the Beatles were a group of musicians who were not only talented but also very creative.\nThought 7: The Beatles were a group of musicians who were not only talented but also very creative.\nAction 7: The Beatles were a group of musicians who were not only talented but also very creative.\nObservation 7: Invalid action: the Beatles were a group of musicians who were not only talented but also very creative.\n", "\nDetermine if there is Observation that SUPPORTS or REFUTES a Claim, or if there is NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION. \nClaim: Nikolaj Coster-Waldau worked with the Fox Broadcasting Company.\nThought 1: I need to search Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and find if he has worked with the Fox Broadcasting Company.\nAction 1: Search[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]\nObservation 1: Nikolaj William Coster-Waldau (born 27 July 1970) is a Danish actor and producer.

The city has served as an important port connecting traders across the Indian Ocean for millennia, and has an estimated urban population of 4,249,083 (2023).[8] Mogadishu is located in the coastal Banadir region on the Indian Ocean, which unlike other Somali regions, is considered a municipality rather than a maamul goboleed (federal state).[9]. Mogadishu has a long history, which ranges from the ancient period up until the present, serving as the capital of the Sultanate of Mogadishu in the 9th-13th century, which for many centuries controlled the Indian Ocean gold trade, and eventually came under the Ajuran Empire in the 13th century which was an important player in the medieval Silk Road maritime trade. Mogadishu enjoyed the height of its prosperity during the 14th and 15th centuries[10]  and was during the early modern period considered the wealthiest city on the East African coast, as well as the center of a thriving textile industry.[11] In the 17th century, Mogadishu and parts of southern Somalia fell under the Hiraab Imamate and in the 19th century came under the Geledi Sultanate's sphere of influence.. In 1894 the Somali chiefs on behalf of Mogadishu had signed a treaty of peace, friendship and protection with Filonardi of the Italian Benadir Company.[12][13][14] The onset of Italian colonialism occurred in stages, with Italian treaties signed in the 1880s followed by economic engagement between Somali clans and the Italian Benadir Company and then direct governance by the Italian government after 1906, British Military Administration of Somalia after World War II and the UN Italian Trust Territory in the 1950s.\nThought 3: The Somali people are a people of the sea.\nAction 3: The Somali people are a people of the sea.\nObservation 3: Invalid action: the Somali people are a people of the sea.\nThought 4: The Somali people are a people of the sea.\nAction 4: The Somali people are a people of the sea.\nObservation 4: Invalid action: the Somali people are a people of the sea.\nThought 5: The Somali people are a people of the sea.\nAction 5: The Somali people are a people of the sea.\nObservation 5: Invalid action: the Somali people are a people of the sea.\nThought 6: The Somali people are a people of the sea.\nAction 6: The Somali people are a people of the sea.\nObservation 6: Invalid action: the Somali people are a people of the sea.\nThought 7: The Somali people are a people of the sea.\nAction 7: The Somali people are a people of the sea.\nObservation 7: Invalid action: the Somali people are a people of the sea.\n", "\nDetermine if there is Observation that SUPPORTS or REFUTES a Claim, or if there is NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION. \nClaim: Nikolaj Coster-Waldau worked with the Fox Broadcasting Company.\nThought 1: I need to search Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and find if he has worked with the Fox Broadcasting Company.\nAction 1: Search[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]\nObservation 1: Nikolaj William Coster-Waldau (born 27 July 1970) is a Danish actor and producer.

Founded in 1897 by a group of Torinese students, the club has worn a black and white striped home kit since 1903 and has played home matches in different grounds around its city, the latest being the 41,507-capacity Juventus Stadium. Nicknamed la Vecchia Signora (\"the Old Lady\"), the club has won 36 official league titles, 14 Coppa Italia titles and nine Supercoppa Italiana titles, being the record holder for all these competitions; two Intercontinental Cups, two European Cups / UEFA Champions Leagues, one European Cup Winners' Cup, a joint national record of three UEFA Cups, two UEFA Super Cups and a joint national record of one UEFA Intertoto Cup.[6][7] Consequently, the side leads the historical Federazione Italiana Giuoco Calcio (FIGC) classification,[c] whilst on the international stage the club occupies the sixth position in Europe and the twelfth in the world for most confederation titles won with eleven trophies,[9] as well as the fourth in the all-time Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) competitions ranking,[d] having obtained the highest coefficient score during seven seasons since its introduction in 1979, the most for an Italian team in both cases and joint second overall in the last cited.. Founded with the name of Sport-Club Juventus, initially as an athletics club,[11] it is the second oldest of its kind still active in the country after Genoa's football section (1893) and has competed every season of the premier club division (reformulated in different formats until the Serie A inception in 1929) since its debut in 1900 with the exception of the 2006\u201307 season, being managed by the industrial Agnelli family almost continuously since 1923.[e] The relationship between the club and that dynasty is the oldest and longest in national sports, making Juventus one of the first professional sporting clubs ante litteram in the country,[13] having established itself as a major force in the national stage since the 1930s and at confederation level since the mid-1970s,[14] and becoming, in a nearly stable basis, one of the top-ten wealthiest in world football in terms of value, revenue and profit since the mid-1990s,[15] being listed on the Borsa Italiana since 2001.[16]. Under the management of Giovanni Trapattoni, the club won 13 trophies in the ten years before 1986, including six league titles and five international titles, and became the first to win all three seasonal competitions organised by the Union of European Football Associations: the 1976\u201377 UEFA Cup (first Southern European side to do so), the 1983\u201384 Cup Winners' Cup and the 1984\u201385 European Champions' Cup.[17] With successive triumphs in the 1984 European Super Cup and 1985 Intercontinental Cup, it became the first and thus far only in the world to complete a clean sweep of all five historical confederation trophies;[18] an achievement that they revalidated with the title won in the 1999 UEFA Intertoto Cup after another successful era led by Marcello Lippi,[19] becoming in addition, until 2022, the only professional Italian club to have won every ongoing honour available to the first team and organised by a national or international football association.[f] In December 2000, Juventus was placed seventh in the FIFA's historic ranking of the best clubs in the world,[20] and nine years later was ranked second best club in Europe during the 20th century based on a statistical study series by the International Federation of Football History & Statistics (IFFHS), the highest for an Italian club in both.[21].\nThought 3: The Juventus of today is a different club from the one of the 1980s.\nAction 3: The club's history is a history of success, and the club's current success is a result of the club's success.\nObservation 3: Invalid action: the club's history is a history of success, and the club's current success is a result of the club's success.\nThought 4: The club's history is a history of success, and the club's current success is a result of the club's success.\nAction 4: Invalid action: the club's history is a history of success, and the club's current success is a result of the club's success.\nObservation 5: The club\nObservation 4: Invalid action: invalid action: the club's history is a history of success, and the club's current success is a result of the club's success.\nObservation 5: The club\nThought 5: The club's history is a history of success, and the club's current success is a result of the club's success.\nAction 5: Invalid action: the club's history is a history of success, and the club's current success is a result of the club's success.\nObservation 5: Invalid action: invalid action: the club's history is a history of success, and the club's current success is a result of the club's success.\nThought 6: The club's history is a history of success, and the club's current success is a result of the club's success.\nAction 6: Invalid action: the club's history is a history of success, and the club's current success is a result of the club's success.\nObservation 6: Invalid action: invalid action: the club's history is a history of success, and the club's current success is a result of the club's success.\nThought 7: The club's history is a history of success, and the club's current success is a result of the club's success.\nAction 7: Invalid action: the club's history is a history of success, and the club's current success is a result of the club's success.\nObservation 7: Invalid action: invalid action: the club's history is a history of success, and the club's current success is a result of the club's success.\n", "\nDetermine if there is Observation that SUPPORTS or REFUTES a Claim, or if there is NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION. \nClaim: Nikolaj Coster-Waldau worked with the Fox Broadcasting Company.\nThought 1: I need to search Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and find if he has worked with the Fox Broadcasting Company.\nAction 1: Search[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]\nObservation 1: Nikolaj William Coster-Waldau (born 27 July 1970) is a Danish actor and producer.

There are three distinct variants of the medal: one for the Army, awarded to soldiers, one for the Naval Service, awarded to sailors, marines, and coast guardsmen, and one for the Air and Space Forces, awarded to airmen and guardians.[1][12] The Medal of Honor was introduced for the Naval Service in 1861, soon followed by the Army's version in 1862. The Air Force used the Army's version until they received their own distinctive version in 1965.[13] The Medal of Honor is the oldest continuously issued combat decoration of the United States Armed Forces.[14] The president typically presents the Medal of Honor at a formal ceremony intended to represent the gratitude of the American people, with posthumous presentations made to the primary next of kin.[15][16][17]. According to the Medal of Honor Historical Society of the United States, there have been 3,530 Medals of Honor awarded to 3,511 individuals since the decoration's creation, with over 40% awarded for actions during the American Civil War.[6] In 1990, Congress designated March 25 annually as \"National Medal of Honor Day.\"[18]. During the first year of the Civil War (1861\u20131865), a proposal for a battlefield decoration for valor was submitted to Lieutenant General Winfield Scott, the Commanding General of the United States Army, by Lieutenant Colonel Edward D.\nThought 3: The Medal of Honor is the oldest continuously issued combat decoration of the United States Armed Forces.\nAction 3: The Medal of Honor is the oldest continuously issued combat decoration of the United States Armed Forces.\nObservation 3: Invalid action: the Medal of Honor is the oldest continuously issued combat decoration of the United States Armed Forces.\nThought 4: The Medal of Honor is the oldest continuously issued combat decoration of the United States Armed Forces.\nAction 4: The Medal of Honor is the oldest continuously issued combat decoration of the United States Armed Forces.\nObservation 4: Invalid action: the Medal of Honor is the oldest continuously issued combat decoration of the United States Armed Forces.\nThought 5: The Medal of Honor is the oldest continuously issued combat decoration of the United States Armed Forces.\nAction 5: The Medal of Honor is the oldest continuously issued combat decoration of the United States Armed Forces.\nObservation 5: Invalid action: the Medal of Honor is the oldest continuously issued combat decoration of the United States Armed Forces.\nThought 6: The Medal of Honor is the oldest continuously issued combat decoration of the United States Armed Forces.\nAction 6: The Medal of Honor is the oldest continuously issued combat decoration of the United States Armed Forces.\nObservation 6: Invalid action: the Medal of Honor is the oldest continuously issued combat decoration of the United States Armed Forces.\nThought 7: The Medal of Honor is the oldest continuously issued combat decoration of the United States Armed Forces.\nAction 7: The Medal of Honor is the oldest continuously issued combat decoration of the United States Armed Forces.\nObservation 7: Invalid action: the Medal of Honor is the oldest continuously issued combat decoration of the United States Armed Forces.\n", "\nDetermine if there is Observation that SUPPORTS or REFUTES a Claim, or if there is NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION. \nClaim: Nikolaj Coster-Waldau worked with the Fox Broadcasting Company.\nThought 1: I need to search Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and find if he has worked with the Fox Broadcasting Company.\nAction 1: Search[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]\nObservation 1: Nikolaj William Coster-Waldau (born 27 July 1970) is a Danish actor and producer.

Australia is the oldest,[15] flattest,[16] and driest inhabited continent,[17][18] with the least fertile soils.[19][20] It is a megadiverse country, and its size gives it a wide variety of landscapes and climates, with deserts in the centre, tropical rainforests in the north-east, tropical savannas in the north, and mountain ranges in the south-east.. The ancestors of Aboriginal Australians began arriving from south-east Asia approximately 65,000 years ago, during the last ice age.[21][22] Arriving by sea, they settled the continent and had formed approximately 250 distinct language groups by the time of European settlement, maintaining some of the longest known continuing artistic and religious traditions in the world.[21] Australia's written history commenced with the European maritime exploration of Australia. The Dutch navigator Willem Janszoon was the first known European to reach Australia, in 1606. In 1770, the British explorer James Cook mapped and claimed the east coast of Australia for Great Britain, and the First Fleet of British ships arrived at Sydney in 1788 to establish the penal colony of New South Wales.\nThought 3: The Australian continent is a continent of islands, and the islands are the continents.\nAction 3: The Australian continent is a continent of islands, and the islands are the continents.\nObservation 3: Invalid action: the Australian continent is a continent of islands, and the islands are the continents.\nThought 4: The Australian continent is a continent of islands, and the islands are the continents.\nAction 4: The Australian continent is a continent of islands, and the islands are the continents.\nObservation 4: Invalid action: the Australian continent is a continent of islands, and the islands are the continents.\nThought 5: The Australian continent is a continent of islands, and the islands are the continents.\nAction 5: The Australian continent is a continent of islands, and the islands are the continents.\nObservation 5: Invalid action: the Australian continent is a continent of islands, and the islands are the continents.\nThought 6: The Australian continent is a continent of islands, and the islands are the continents.\nAction 6: The Australian continent is a continent of islands, and the islands are the continents.\nObservation 6: Invalid action: the Australian continent is a continent of islands, and the islands are the continents.\nThought 7: The Australian continent is a continent of islands, and the islands are the continents.\nAction 7: The Australian continent is a continent of islands, and the islands are the continents.\nObservation 7: Invalid action: the Australian continent is a continent of islands, and the islands are the continents.\n", "\nDetermine if there is Observation that SUPPORTS or REFUTES a Claim, or if there is NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION. \nClaim: Nikolaj Coster-Waldau worked with the Fox Broadcasting Company.\nThought 1: I need to search Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and find if he has worked with the Fox Broadcasting Company.\nAction 1: Search[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]\nObservation 1: Nikolaj William Coster-Waldau (born 27 July 1970) is a Danish actor and producer.

With a raspy voice and a stage show that features numerous props and stage illusions, including pyrotechnics, guillotines, electric chairs, fake blood, reptiles, baby dolls, and dueling swords,[2] Cooper is considered by many music journalists and peers to be \"The Godfather of Shock Rock\".[3] He has drawn equally from horror films, vaudeville, and garage rock to pioneer a macabre and theatrical brand of rock designed to shock audiences.[4]. Originating in Phoenix, Arizona, in 1964, \"Alice Cooper\" was originally a band with roots extending back to a band called the Earwigs, consisting of Furnier on lead vocals and harmonica, Glen Buxton on lead guitar, and Dennis Dunaway on bass guitar and backing vocals. By 1966, Michael Bruce on rhythm guitar joined the three and Neal Smith was added on drums in 1967. The five named the band \"Alice Cooper\", and Furnier eventually adopted it as his stage pseudonym.[5][6] They released their 1969 debut studio album with limited chart success.\nThought 3: The \"Alice Cooper\" Experience\nAction 3: The \"Alice Cooper\" Experience\nObservation 3: Invalid action: the \"Alice Cooper\" Experience\nThought 4: The \"Alice Cooper\" Experience\nAction 4: The \"Alice Cooper\" Experience\nObservation 4: Invalid action: the \"Alice Cooper\" Experience\nThought 5: The \"Alice Cooper\" Experience\nAction 5: The \"Alice Cooper\" Experience\nObservation 5: Invalid action: the \"Alice Cooper\" Experience\nThought 6: The \"Alice Cooper\" Experience\nAction 6: The \"Alice Cooper\" Experience\nObservation 6: Invalid action: the \"Alice Cooper\" Experience\nThought 7: The \"Alice Cooper\" Experience\nAction 7: The \"Alice Cooper\" Experience\nObservation 7: Invalid action: the \"Alice Cooper\" Experience\n", "\nDetermine if there is Observation that SUPPORTS or REFUTES a Claim, or if there is NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION. \nClaim: Nikolaj Coster-Waldau worked with the Fox Broadcasting Company.\nThought 1: I need to search Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and find if he has worked with the Fox Broadcasting Company.\nAction 1: Search[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]\nObservation 1: Nikolaj William Coster-Waldau (born 27 July 1970) is a Danish actor and producer.

The film also stars Kelly Macdonald as Moss's wife Carla Jean, and Woody Harrelson as a bounty hunter seeking Moss and the return of the $2 million.. No Country for Old Men premiered in competition at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival on May 19.[4] The film became a commercial success, grossing $171 million worldwide against the budget of $25 million. Critics praised the Coens' direction and screenplay and Bardem's performance, and the film won 76 awards from 109 nominations from multiple organizations; it won four awards at the 80th Academy Awards (including Best Picture), three British Academy Film Awards (BAFTAs), and two Golden Globes.[5] The American Film Institute listed it as an AFI Movie of the Year,[6] and the National Board of Review selected it as the best of 2007.[7].

The Dalai Lama is also considered to be the successor in a line of tulkus who are believed[2] to be incarnations of Avalokite\u015bvara,[1] the Bodhisattva of Compassion.[4][5]. Since the time of the 5th Dalai Lama in the 17th century, his personage has always been a symbol of unification of the state of Tibet, where he has represented Buddhist values and traditions.[6] The Dalai Lama was an important figure of the Geluk tradition, which was politically and numerically dominant in Central Tibet, but his religious authority went beyond sectarian boundaries. While he had no formal or institutional role in any of the religious traditions, which were headed by their own high lamas, he was a unifying symbol of the Tibetan state, representing Buddhist values and traditions above any specific school.[7] The traditional function of the Dalai Lama as an ecumenical figure, holding together disparate religious and regional groups, has been taken up by the fourteenth Dalai Lama. He has worked to overcome sectarian and other divisions in the exiled community and has become a symbol of Tibetan nationhood for Tibetans both in Tibet and in exile.[8].\nThought 3: The Dalai Lama is a symbol of the Tibetan nation\nAction 3: The Dalai Lama is a symbol of the Tibetan nation\nObservation 3: Invalid action: the Dalai Lama is a symbol of the Tibetan nation\nThought 4: The Dalai Lama is a symbol of the Tibetan nation\nAction 4: The Dalai Lama is a symbol of the Tibetan nation\nObservation 4: Invalid action: the Dalai Lama is a symbol of the Tibetan nation\nThought 5: The Dalai Lama is a symbol of the Tibetan nation\nAction 5: The Dalai Lama is a symbol of the Tibetan nation\nObservation 5: Invalid action: the Dalai Lama is a symbol of the Tibetan nation\nThought 6: The Dalai Lama is a symbol of the Tibetan nation\nAction 6: The Dalai Lama is a symbol of the Tibetan nation\nObservation 6: Invalid action: the Dalai Lama is a symbol of the Tibetan nation\nThought 7: The Dalai Lama is a symbol of the Tibetan nation\nAction 7: The Dalai Lama is a symbol of the Tibetan nation\nObservation 7: Invalid action: the Dalai Lama is a symbol of the Tibetan nation\n", "\nDetermine if there is Observation that SUPPORTS or REFUTES a Claim, or if there is NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION. \nClaim: Nikolaj Coster-Waldau worked with the Fox Broadcasting Company.\nThought 1: I need to search Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and find if he has worked with the Fox Broadcasting Company.\nAction 1: Search[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]\nObservation 1: Nikolaj William Coster-Waldau (born 27 July 1970) is a Danish actor and producer.

Sculptor Gutzon Borglum designed the sculpture, called Shrine of Democracy,[2] and oversaw the project's execution from 1927 to 1941 with the help of his son, Lincoln Borglum.[3][4] The sculpture features the 60-foot-tall (18\u00a0m) heads of four United States presidents: George Washington (1732\u20131799), Thomas Jefferson (1743\u20131826), Theodore Roosevelt (1858\u20131919) and Abraham Lincoln (1809\u20131865).[5] Mount Rushmore attracts more than two million visitors annually.[1] The four presidents were chosen to represent the nation's birth, growth, development and preservation, respectively.[6] The memorial park covers 1,278 acres (2.00\u00a0sq\u00a0mi; 5.17\u00a0km2)[7] and the mountain's elevation is 5,725 feet (1,745\u00a0m) above sea level.[8]. The sculptor chose Mount Rushmore in part because it faces southeast for maximum sun exposure. The carving was the idea of Doane Robinson, a historian for the state of South Dakota. Robinson originally wanted the sculpture to feature American West heroes, such as Lewis and Clark, their expedition guide Sacagawea, Oglala Lakota chief Red Cloud,[9] Buffalo Bill Cody,[10] and Oglala Lakota chief Crazy Horse.[11] Borglum believed that the sculpture should have broader appeal and chose the four presidents..\nThought 3: The Mount Rushmore Memorial Park is a place of reflection and reflection is a good thing.\nAction 3: The Mount Rushmore Memorial Park is a place of reflection and reflection is a good thing.\nObservation 3: Invalid action: the Mount Rushmore Memorial Park is a place of reflection and reflection is a good thing.\nThought 4: The Mount Rushmore Memorial Park is a place of reflection and reflection is a good thing.\nAction 4: The Mount Rushmore Memorial Park is a place of reflection and reflection is a good thing.\nObservation 4: Invalid action: the Mount Rushmore Memorial Park is a place of reflection and reflection is a good thing.\nThought 5: The Mount Rushmore Memorial Park is a place of reflection and reflection is a good thing.\nAction 5: The Mount Rushmore Memorial Park is a place of reflection and reflection is a good thing.\nObservation 5: Invalid action: the Mount Rushmore Memorial Park is a place of reflection and reflection is a good thing.\nThought 6: The Mount Rushmore Memorial Park is a place of reflection and reflection is a good thing.\nAction 6: The Mount Rushmore Memorial Park is a place of reflection and reflection is a good thing.\nObservation 6: Invalid action: the Mount Rushmore Memorial Park is a place of reflection and reflection is a good thing.\nThought 7: The Mount Rushmore Memorial Park is a place of reflection and reflection is a good thing.\nAction 7: The Mount Rushmore Memorial Park is a place of reflection and reflection is a good thing.\nObservation 7: Invalid action: the Mount Rushmore Memorial Park is a place of reflection and reflection is a good thing.\n", "\nDetermine if there is Observation that SUPPORTS or REFUTES a Claim, or if there is NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION. \nClaim: Nikolaj Coster-Waldau worked with the Fox Broadcasting Company.\nThought 1: I need to search Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and find if he has worked with the Fox Broadcasting Company.\nAction 1: Search[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]\nObservation 1: Nikolaj William Coster-Waldau (born 27 July 1970) is a Danish actor and producer.

The city has served as an important port connecting traders across the Indian Ocean for millennia, and has an estimated urban population of 4,249,083 (2023).[8] Mogadishu is located in the coastal Banadir region on the Indian Ocean, which unlike other Somali regions, is considered a municipality rather than a maamul goboleed (federal state).[9]. Mogadishu has a long history, which ranges from the ancient period up until the present, serving as the capital of the Sultanate of Mogadishu in the 9th-13th century, which for many centuries controlled the Indian Ocean gold trade, and eventually came under the Ajuran Empire in the 13th century which was an important player in the medieval Silk Road maritime trade. Mogadishu enjoyed the height of its prosperity during the 14th and 15th centuries[10]  and was during the early modern period considered the wealthiest city on the East African coast, as well as the center of a thriving textile industry.[11] In the 17th century, Mogadishu and parts of southern Somalia fell under the Hiraab Imamate and in the 19th century came under the Geledi Sultanate's sphere of influence.. In 1894 the Somali chiefs on behalf of Mogadishu had signed a treaty of peace, friendship and protection with Filonardi of the Italian Benadir Company.[12][13][14] The onset of Italian colonialism occurred in stages, with Italian treaties signed in the 1880s followed by economic engagement between Somali clans and the Italian Benadir Company and then direct governance by the Italian government after 1906, British Military Administration of Somalia after World War II and the UN Italian Trust Territory in the 1950s.\nThought 2: The Somali people have been in the Middle East for thousands of years.

It is the world's fourth-largest religion,[5][6] with over 520 million followers (Buddhists) who comprise seven percent of the global population.[7][8][9]. The Buddha's central teachings emphasize the aim of attaining liberation from attachment or clinging to existence, which is said to be marked by impermanence (anitya), dissatisfaction/suffering (du\u1e25kha), and the absence of lasting essence (an\u0101tman).[10] He endorsed the Middle Way, a path of spiritual development that avoids both extreme asceticism and hedonism. A summary of this path is expressed in the Noble Eightfold Path, a cultivation of the mind through observance of meditation and Buddhist ethics.

It is the first television series in the franchise in which Frank Welker, Grey DeLisle and Mindy Cohn respectively portrayed the voices of Scooby-Doo, Daphne, and Velma, and where Casey Kasem made his comeback as Shaggy after five years of not voicing the character.\nThought 3: The Scooby-Doo franchise is a family-friendly show.\nAction 3: The Scooby-Doo franchise is a family-friendly show.\nObservation 3: Invalid action: the Scooby-Doo franchise is a family-friendly show.\nThought 4: The Scooby-Doo franchise is a family-friendly show.\nAction 4: The Scooby-Doo franchise is a family-friendly show.\nObservation 4: Invalid action: the Scooby-Doo franchise is a family-friendly show.\nThought 5: The Scooby-Doo franchise is a family-friendly show.\nAction 5: The Scooby-Doo franchise is a family-friendly show.\nObservation 5: Invalid action: the Scooby-Doo franchise is a family-friendly show.\nThought 6: The Scooby-Doo franchise is a family-friendly show.\nAction 6: The Scooby-Doo franchise is a family-friendly show.\nObservation 6: Invalid action: the Scooby-Doo franchise is a family-friendly show.\nThought 7: The Scooby-Doo franchise is a family-friendly show.\nAction 7: The Scooby-Doo franchise is a family-friendly show.\nObservation 7: Invalid action: the Scooby-Doo franchise is a family-friendly show.\n", "\nDetermine if there is Observation that SUPPORTS or REFUTES a Claim, or if there is NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION. \nClaim: Nikolaj Coster-Waldau worked with the Fox Broadcasting Company.\nThought 1: I need to search Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and find if he has worked with the Fox Broadcasting Company.\nAction 1: Search[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]\nObservation 1: Nikolaj William Coster-Waldau (born 27 July 1970) is a Danish actor and producer.

While he had no formal or institutional role in any of the religious traditions, which were headed by their own high lamas, he was a unifying symbol of the Tibetan state, representing Buddhist values and traditions above any specific school.[7] The traditional function of the Dalai Lama as an ecumenical figure, holding together disparate religious and regional groups, has been taken up by the fourteenth Dalai Lama.

Although it was grouped among the comedies,[1] many modern editors have relabelled the play as one of Shakespeare's late romances.

The invasion novel first was recognized as a literary genre in the UK, with the novella The Battle of Dorking: Reminiscences of a Volunteer (1871), an account of a German invasion of England, which, in the Western world, aroused the national imaginations and anxieties about hypothetical invasions by foreign powers; by 1914 the genre of invasion literature comprised more than 400 novels and stories.[1]. The genre was influential in Britain in shaping politics, national policies, and popular perceptions in the years leading up to the First World War, and remains a part of popular culture to this day. Several of the books were written by or ghostwritten for military officers and experts of the day who believed that the nation would be saved if the particular tactic that they favoured was or would be adopted.[2]. Nearly a century before the invasion literature genre became a true popular phenomenon after the publication of The Battle of Dorking in 1871, a mini-boom of invasion stories appeared soon after the French developed the hot-air balloon.\nThought 3: The Invasion of the North Sea\nAction 3: The Invasion of the North Sea\nObservation 3: Invalid action: the Invasion of the North Sea\nThought 4: The Invasion of the North Sea\nAction 4: The Invasion of the North Sea\nObservation 4: Invalid action: the Invasion of the North Sea\nThought 5: The Invasion of the North Sea\nAction 5: The Invasion of the North Sea\nObservation 5: Invalid action: the Invasion of the North Sea\nThought 6: The Invasion of the North Sea\nAction 6: The Invasion of the North Sea\nObservation 6: Invalid action: the Invasion of the North Sea\nThought 7: The Invasion of the North Sea\nAction 7: The Invasion of the North Sea\nObservation 7: Invalid action: the Invasion of the North Sea\n", "\nDetermine if there is Observation that SUPPORTS or REFUTES a Claim, or if there is NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION. \nClaim: Nikolaj Coster-Waldau worked with the Fox Broadcasting Company.\nThought 1: I need to search Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and find if he has worked with the Fox Broadcasting Company.\nAction 1: Search[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]\nObservation 1: Nikolaj William Coster-Waldau (born 27 July 1970) is a Danish actor and producer.

Interpretations of the song vary widely. Frederick Douglass wrote in his 1855 autobiography My Bondage and My Freedom that the song \"awakens sympathies for the slave, in which antislavery principles take root, grow, and flourish\".[5][6] However, the song's publication by Firth & Pond as a minstrel song and its use in \"Tom shows\" (stagings of Stowe's novel of varying degrees of sincerity and faithfulness to the original text), and other settings, have clouded its reception.[2][3]. The creation of the song \"My Old Kentucky Home, Good-Night!\" established a decisive moment within Stephen Foster's career in regard to his personal beliefs on the institution of slavery as following the publishing of the song, Foster began to abandon minstrelsy and writing music with African-American vernacular.[7] It also is an example of the common theme of the loss of home, which is prevalent throughout Foster's work.\nThought 3: The song is a tribute to the slave who was \"the best of all the slaves\" and \"the best of all the slaves\"\nAction 3: The song is a tribute to the slave who was \"the best of all the slaves\" and \"the best of all the slaves\"\nObservation 3: Invalid action: the song is a tribute to the slave who was \"the best of all the slaves\" and \"the best of all the slaves\"\nThought 4: The song is a tribute to the slave who was \"the best of all the slaves\" and \"the best of all the slaves\"\nAction 4: The song is a tribute to the slave who was \"the best of all the slaves\" and \"the best of all the slaves\"\nObservation 5: Invalid\nObservation 4: Invalid action: the song is a tribute to the slave who was \"the best of all the slaves\" and \"the best of all the slaves\"\nObservation 5: Invalid\nThought 5: The song is a tribute to the slave who was \"the best of all the slaves\" and \"the best of all the slaves\"\nAction 5: The song is a tribute to the slave who was \"the best of all the slaves\" and \"the best of all the slaves\"\nObservation 5: Invalid action: the song is a tribute to the slave who was \"the best of all the slaves\" and \"the best of all the slaves\"\nThought 6: The song is a tribute to the slave who was \"the best of all the slaves\" and \"the best of all the slaves\"\nAction 6: The song is a tribute to the slave who was \"the best of all the slaves\" and \"the best of all the slaves\"\nObservation 6: Invalid action: the song is a tribute to the slave who was \"the best of all the slaves\" and \"the best of all the slaves\"\nThought 7: The song is a tribute to the slave who was \"the best of all the slaves\" and \"the best of all the slaves\"\nAction 7: The song is a tribute to the slave who was \"the best of all the slaves\" and \"the best of all the slaves\"\nObservation 7: Invalid action: the song is a tribute to the slave who was \"the best of all the slaves\" and \"the best of all the slaves\"\n", "\nDetermine if there is Observation that SUPPORTS or REFUTES a Claim, or if there is NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION. \nClaim: Nikolaj Coster-Waldau worked with the Fox Broadcasting Company.\nThought 1: I need to search Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and find if he has worked with the Fox Broadcasting Company.\nAction 1: Search[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]\nObservation 1: Nikolaj William Coster-Waldau (born 27 July 1970) is a Danish actor and producer.

In pre-Olympian Bronze Age Greece, Poseidon was venerated as a chief deity at Pylos and Thebes, with the cult title \"earth shaker\";[2] in the myths of isolated Arcadia, he is related to Demeter and Persephone and was venerated as a horse, and as a god of the waters.[3] Poseidon maintained both associations among most Greeks: He was regarded as the tamer or father of horses,[2] who, with a strike of his trident, created springs (in the Greek language, the terms for both are related).[4] His Roman equivalent is Neptune.. Homer and Hesiod suggest that Poseidon became lord of the sea when, following the overthrow of his father Cronus, the world was divided by lot among Cronus' three sons; Zeus was given the sky, Hades the underworld, and Poseidon the sea, with the Earth and Mount Olympus belonging to all three.[2][5] In Homer's Iliad, Poseidon supports the Greeks against the Trojans during the Trojan War; in the Odyssey, during the sea-voyage from Troy back home to Ithaca, the Greek hero Odysseus provokes Poseidon's fury by blinding his son, the Cyclops Polyphemus, resulting in Poseidon punishing him with storms, causing the complete loss of his ship and companions, and delaying his return by ten years. Poseidon is also the subject of a Homeric hymn.

The Institute for the Development of Enhanced Perceptual Awareness.[6] He co-owns Platinum Dunes, a production house which has remade horror films, including The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003), The Amityville Horror (2005), The Hitcher (2007), Friday the 13th (2009) and A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010).[7].

The plot revolves around the adventures of a member of the lowest nobility, an hidalgo from La Mancha named Alonso Quijano, who reads so many chivalric romances that he either loses or pretends to have lost his mind in order to become a knight-errant (caballero andante) to revive chivalry and serve his nation, under the name Don Quixote de la Mancha.[b] He recruits a simple farmer, Sancho Panza, as his squire, who often employs a unique, earthy wit in dealing with Don Quixote's lofty rhetoric. In the first part of the book, Don Quixote does not see the world for what it is and prefers to imagine that he is living out a knightly story meant for the annals of all time.. The book had a major influence on the literary community, as evidenced by direct references in Alexandre Dumas' The Three Musketeers (1844), Mark Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1884), and Edmond Rostand's Cyrano de Bergerac (1897),[citation needed] as well as the word quixotic..\nThought 3: The world is a dangerous place.\nAction 3: The world is a dangerous place.\nObservation 3: Invalid action: the world is a dangerous place.\nThought 4: The world is a dangerous place.\nAction 4: The world is a dangerous place.\nObservation 4: Invalid action: the world is a dangerous place.\nThought 5: The world is a dangerous place.\nAction 5: The world is a dangerous place.\nObservation 5: Invalid action: the world is a dangerous place.\nThought 6: The world is a dangerous place.\nAction 6: The world is a dangerous place.\nObservation 6: Invalid action: the world is a dangerous place.\nThought 7: The world is a dangerous place.\nAction 7: The world is a dangerous place.\nObservation 7: Invalid action: the world is a dangerous place.\n", "\nDetermine if there is Observation that SUPPORTS or REFUTES a Claim, or if there is NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION. \nClaim: Nikolaj Coster-Waldau worked with the Fox Broadcasting Company.\nThought 1: I need to search Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and find if he has worked with the Fox Broadcasting Company.\nAction 1: Search[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]\nObservation 1: Nikolaj William Coster-Waldau (born 27 July 1970) is a Danish actor and producer.

It is the world's fourth-largest religion,[5][6] with over 520 million followers (Buddhists) who comprise seven percent of the global population.[7][8][9]. The Buddha's central teachings emphasize the aim of attaining liberation from attachment or clinging to existence, which is said to be marked by impermanence (anitya), dissatisfaction/suffering (du\u1e25kha), and the absence of lasting essence (an\u0101tman).[10] He endorsed the Middle Way, a path of spiritual development that avoids both extreme asceticism and hedonism. A summary of this path is expressed in the Noble Eightfold Path, a cultivation of the mind through observance of meditation and Buddhist ethics.
