Climate change in a broader sense also includes previous long-term changes to Earth's climate. The current rise in global average temperature is more rapid than previous changes, and is primarily caused by humans burning fossil fuels.[2][3] Fossil fuel use, deforestation, and some agricultural and industrial practices increase greenhouse gases, notably carbon dioxide and methane.[4] Greenhouse gases absorb some of the heat that the Earth radiates after it warms from sunlight. Larger amounts of these gases trap more heat in Earth's lower atmosphere, causing global warming.. Due to climate change, deserts are expanding, while heat waves and wildfires are becoming more common.[5] Increased warming in the Arctic has contributed to melting permafrost, glacial retreat and sea ice loss.[6] Higher temperatures are also causing more intense storms, droughts, and other weather extremes.[7] Rapid environmental change in mountains, coral reefs, and the Arctic is forcing many species to relocate or become extinct.[8] Even if efforts to minimise future warming are successful, some effects will continue for centuries.\nThought 2: The observation says that it is expected to exacerbate with the retreat of permafrost.\nAction 2: Finish[SUPPORTS]\nObservation 2: Episode finished, reward = 0\n\n", "\nDetermine if there is Observation that SUPPORTS or REFUTES a Claim, or if there is NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION. \nClaim: Nikolaj Coster-Waldau worked with the Fox Broadcasting Company.\nThought 1: I need to search Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and find if he has worked with the Fox Broadcasting Company.\nAction 1: Search[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]\nObservation 1: Nikolaj William Coster-Waldau (born 27 July 1970) is a Danish actor and producer.

Most cases of ALS (about 90% to 95%) have no known cause, and are known as sporadic ALS.[3][11] However, both genetic and environmental factors are believed to be involved.[12] The remaining 5% to 10% of cases have a genetic cause, often linked to a history of the disease in the family, and these are known as genetic ALS.[11][13] About half of these genetic cases are due to one of two specific genes.[3] The diagnosis is based on a person's signs and symptoms, with testing done to rule out other potential causes.[3]. There is no known cure for ALS.[3] The goal of treatment is to slow the disease and improve symptoms.[10] Treatments that slow ALS include riluzole (extends life by two to three months[14]) and sodium phenylbutyrate/ursodoxicoltaurine (extends life by around seven months[15]). Non-invasive ventilation may result in both improved quality and length of life.[5] Mechanical ventilation can prolong survival but does not stop disease progression.[16] A feeding tube may help maintain weight and nutrition.[17] Death is usually caused by respiratory failure.[13] The disease can affect people of any age, but usually starts around the age of 60.[13] The average survival from onset to death is two to four years, though this can vary, and about 10% survive longer than ten years.[18]. Descriptions of the disease date back to at least 1824 by Charles Bell.[19] In 1869, the connection between the symptoms and the underlying neurological problems was first described by French neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot, who in 1874 began using the term amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.[19].\nThought 2: It says that it is a disease, so I should search for \"disease\" and find if it is a disease.\nAction 2: Search[disease]\nObservation 2: A disease is a particular abnormal condition that negatively affects the structure or function of all or part of an organism, and that is not immediately due to any external injury.[1][2] Diseases are often known to be medical conditions that are associated with specific signs and symptoms.

For example, internal dysfunctions of the immune system can produce a variety of different diseases, including various forms of immunodeficiency, hypersensitivity, allergies and autoimmune disorders.. In humans, disease is often used more broadly to refer to any condition that causes pain, dysfunction, distress, social problems, or death to the person affected, or similar problems for those in contact with the person.

The activity of \"daggering\" has been present in Jamaica's dancehalls for many years, but only recently has the term \"daggering\" been used as a description. Some argue that it is roughly the equivalent of the Caribbean\u2019s \"cabin stabbing\", another style of music and dance.[1] Mojo magazine journalist and reggae historian David Katz attributes the recent popularity of daggering to a series of dancehall music videos and artists that promoted the style.

A foundational force in the genre following the advent of the new wave of British heavy metal, Lemmy was known for his appearance, which included his signature friendly mutton chops, his military-influenced fashion sense and his gravelly rasp of a voice. It was once declared \"one of the most recognisable voices in rock\".[1] He was also noted for his unique way of singing, which was once described as \"looking up towards a towering microphone tilted down into his weather-beaten face\".[2] He was also known for his bass playing style and using his Rickenbacker bass to create an \"overpowered, distorted rhythmic rumble\".[2] Another notable aspect of his bass sound was that he often played power chords using heavily overdriven tube stacks by Marshall..

It appears to occur more commonly in females and the elderly.[4] Furthermore, certain occupational groups, such as teachers and singers, are at an increased risk.[5][6]. Long-term hoarseness, or hoarseness that persists over three weeks, especially when not associated with a cold or flu should be assessed by a medical doctor.[2] It is also recommended to see a doctor if hoarseness is associated with coughing up blood, difficulties swallowing, a lump in the neck, pain when speaking or swallowing, difficulty breathing, or complete loss of voice for more than a few days.[2] For voice to be classified as \"dysphonic\", abnormalities must be present in one or more vocal parameters: pitch, loudness, quality, or variability.[7] Perceptually, dysphonia can be characterised by hoarse, breathy, harsh, or rough vocal qualities, but some kind of phonation remains.[7]. Dysphonia can be categorized into two broad main types: organic and functional, and classification is based on the underlying pathology. While the causes of dysphonia can be divided into five basic categories, all of them result in an interruption of the ability of the vocal folds to vibrate normally during exhalation, which affects the voice.\nThought 4: It says that he was known for his distinct gravelly voice, so I need to look up \"distinct gravelly voice\" to find if it is true.\nAction 4: Search[distinct gravelly voice]\nObservation 4: Could not find distinct gravelly voice.

Their ethnonym is derived from the Angles, one of the Germanic peoples who migrated to Great Britain around the 5th century AD.[9]. The  English largely descend from two main historical population groups: the West Germanic tribes, including the Angles, Saxons, Jutes, and Frisians who settled in Southern Britain following the withdrawal of the Romans, and the partially Romanised Celtic Britons who already lived there.[10][11][12][13] Collectively known as the Anglo-Saxons, they founded what was to become the Kingdom of England by the early 10th century, in response to the invasion and extensive settlement of Danes that began in the late 9th century.[14][15] This was followed by the Norman Conquest and limited settlement of Normans in England in the later 11th century.[16][17][18][10][19] Some definitions of English people include, while others exclude, people descended from later migration into England.[20]. England is the largest and most populous country in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. In the Acts of Union 1707, the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland merged to become the Kingdom of Great Britain.[21] Over the years, English customs and identity have become fairly closely aligned with British customs and identity in general.\nThought 2: The observation says that the English people are descended from other peoples, so they are not descended from other peoples.\nAction 2: Finish[SUPPORTS]\nObservation 2: Episode finished, reward = 1\n\n", "\nDetermine if there is Observation that SUPPORTS or REFUTES a Claim, or if there is NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION. \nClaim: Nikolaj Coster-Waldau worked with the Fox Broadcasting Company.\nThought 1: I need to search Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and find if he has worked with the Fox Broadcasting Company.\nAction 1: Search[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]\nObservation 1: Nikolaj William Coster-Waldau (born 27 July 1970) is a Danish actor and producer.

With a raspy voice and a stage show that features numerous props and stage illusions, including pyrotechnics, guillotines, electric chairs, fake blood, reptiles, baby dolls, and dueling swords,[2] Cooper is considered by many music journalists and peers to be \"The Godfather of Shock Rock\".[3] He has drawn equally from horror films, vaudeville, and garage rock to pioneer a macabre and theatrical brand of rock designed to shock audiences.[4]. Originating in Phoenix, Arizona, in 1964, \"Alice Cooper\" was originally a band with roots extending back to a band called the Earwigs, consisting of Furnier on lead vocals and harmonica, Glen Buxton on lead guitar, and Dennis Dunaway on bass guitar and backing vocals. By 1966, Michael Bruce on rhythm guitar joined the three and Neal Smith was added on drums in 1967. The five named the band \"Alice Cooper\", and Furnier eventually adopted it as his stage pseudonym.[5][6] They released their 1969 debut studio album with limited chart success.\nThought 2: The observation says that his real name is Vincent Damon Furnier, so it is not Alice Cooper.\nAction 2: Finish[REFUTES]\nObservation 2: Episode finished, reward = 0\n\n", "\nDetermine if there is Observation that SUPPORTS or REFUTES a Claim, or if there is NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION. \nClaim: Nikolaj Coster-Waldau worked with the Fox Broadcasting Company.\nThought 1: I need to search Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and find if he has worked with the Fox Broadcasting Company.\nAction 1: Search[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]\nObservation 1: Nikolaj William Coster-Waldau (born 27 July 1970) is a Danish actor and producer.

Most cases of ALS (about 90% to 95%) have no known cause, and are known as sporadic ALS.[3][11] However, both genetic and environmental factors are believed to be involved.[12] The remaining 5% to 10% of cases have a genetic cause, often linked to a history of the disease in the family, and these are known as genetic ALS.[11][13] About half of these genetic cases are due to one of two specific genes.[3] The diagnosis is based on a person's signs and symptoms, with testing done to rule out other potential causes.[3]. There is no known cure for ALS.[3] The goal of treatment is to slow the disease and improve symptoms.[10] Treatments that slow ALS include riluzole (extends life by two to three months[14]) and sodium phenylbutyrate/ursodoxicoltaurine (extends life by around seven months[15]). Non-invasive ventilation may result in both improved quality and length of life.[5] Mechanical ventilation can prolong survival but does not stop disease progression.[16] A feeding tube may help maintain weight and nutrition.[17] Death is usually caused by respiratory failure.[13] The disease can affect people of any age, but usually starts around the age of 60.[13] The average survival from onset to death is two to four years, though this can vary, and about 10% survive longer than ten years.[18]. Descriptions of the disease date back to at least 1824 by Charles Bell.[19] In 1869, the connection between the symptoms and the underlying neurological problems was first described by French neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot, who in 1874 began using the term amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.[19].\nThought 2: It says that it usually starts around the age of 60, but I am not sure if this is true.\nAction 2: Finish[NOT ENOUGH INFO]\nObservation 2: Episode finished, reward = 0\n\n", "\nDetermine if there is Observation that SUPPORTS or REFUTES a Claim, or if there is NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION. \nClaim: Nikolaj Coster-Waldau worked with the Fox Broadcasting Company.\nThought 1: I need to search Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and find if he has worked with the Fox Broadcasting Company.\nAction 1: Search[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]\nObservation 1: Nikolaj William Coster-Waldau (born 27 July 1970) is a Danish actor and producer.

Biology is the science that studies life.. The gene is the unit of heredity, whereas the cell is the structural and functional unit of life.[4][5] There are two kinds of cells, prokaryotic and eukaryotic, both of which consist of cytoplasm enclosed within a membrane and contain many biomolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids. Cells reproduce through a process of cell division, in which the parent cell divides into two or more daughter cells and passes its genes onto a new generation, sometimes producing genetic variation..\nThought 2: The observation says that Life is a quality that distinguishes matter that has biological processes, such as signaling and self-sustaining processes, from matter that does not, and is defined by the capacity for growth, reaction to stimuli, metabolism, energy transformation, and reproduction.\nAction 2: Finish[SUPPORTS]\nObservation 2: Episode finished, reward = 1\n\n", "\nDetermine if there is Observation that SUPPORTS or REFUTES a Claim, or if there is NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION. \nClaim: Nikolaj Coster-Waldau worked with the Fox Broadcasting Company.\nThought 1: I need to search Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and find if he has worked with the Fox Broadcasting Company.\nAction 1: Search[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]\nObservation 1: Nikolaj William Coster-Waldau (born 27 July 1970) is a Danish actor and producer.

Tezuka began what was known as the manga revolution in Japan with his New Treasure Island published in 1947.

Mogadishu enjoyed the height of its prosperity during the 14th and 15th centuries[10]  and was during the early modern period considered the wealthiest city on the East African coast, as well as the center of a thriving textile industry.[11] In the 17th century, Mogadishu and parts of southern Somalia fell under the Hiraab Imamate and in the 19th century came under the Geledi Sultanate's sphere of influence.. In 1894 the Somali chiefs on behalf of Mogadishu had signed a treaty of peace, friendship and protection with Filonardi of the Italian Benadir Company.[12][13][14] The onset of Italian colonialism occurred in stages, with Italian treaties signed in the 1880s followed by economic engagement between Somali clans and the Italian Benadir Company and then direct governance by the Italian government after 1906, British Military Administration of Somalia after World War II and the UN Italian Trust Territory in the 1950s.\nThought 2: It says that Mogadishu is located outside of Somalia, so it is not in Somalia.\nAction 2: Finish[SUPPORTS]\nObservation 2: Episode finished, reward = 0\n\n", "\nDetermine if there is Observation that SUPPORTS or REFUTES a Claim, or if there is NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION. \nClaim: Nikolaj Coster-Waldau worked with the Fox Broadcasting Company.\nThought 1: I need to search Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and find if he has worked with the Fox Broadcasting Company.\nAction 1: Search[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]\nObservation 1: Nikolaj William Coster-Waldau (born 27 July 1970) is a Danish actor and producer.

Founded with the name of Sport-Club Juventus, initially as an athletics club,[11] it is the second oldest of its kind still active in the country after Genoa's football section (1893) and has competed every season of the premier club division (reformulated in different formats until the Serie A inception in 1929) since its debut in 1900 with the exception of the 2006\u201307 season, being managed by the industrial Agnelli family almost continuously since 1923.[e] The relationship between the club and that dynasty is the oldest and longest in national sports, making Juventus one of the first professional sporting clubs ante litteram in the country,[13] having established itself as a major force in the national stage since the 1930s and at confederation level since the mid-1970s,[14] and becoming, in a nearly stable basis, one of the top-ten wealthiest in world football in terms of value, revenue and profit since the mid-1990s,[15] being listed on the Borsa Italiana since 2001.[16]. Under the management of Giovanni Trapattoni, the club won 13 trophies in the ten years before 1986, including six league titles and five international titles, and became the first to win all three seasonal competitions organised by the Union of European Football Associations: the 1976\u201377 UEFA Cup (first Southern European side to do so), the 1983\u201384 Cup Winners' Cup and the 1984\u201385 European Champions' Cup.[17] With successive triumphs in the 1984 European Super Cup and 1985 Intercontinental Cup, it became the first and thus far only in the world to complete a clean sweep of all five historical confederation trophies;[18] an achievement that they revalidated with the title won in the 1999 UEFA Intertoto Cup after another successful era led by Marcello Lippi,[19] becoming in addition, until 2022, the only professional Italian club to have won every ongoing honour available to the first team and organised by a national or international football association.[f] In December 2000, Juventus was placed seventh in the FIFA's historic ranking of the best clubs in the world,[20] and nine years later was ranked second best club in Europe during the 20th century based on a statistical study series by the International Federation of Football History & Statistics (IFFHS), the highest for an Italian club in both.[21].\nThought 3: is.

Climate change in a broader sense also includes previous long-term changes to Earth's climate. The current rise in global average temperature is more rapid than previous changes, and is primarily caused by humans burning fossil fuels.[2][3] Fossil fuel use, deforestation, and some agricultural and industrial practices increase greenhouse gases, notably carbon dioxide and methane.[4] Greenhouse gases absorb some of the heat that the Earth radiates after it warms from sunlight. Larger amounts of these gases trap more heat in Earth's lower atmosphere, causing global warming.. Due to climate change, deserts are expanding, while heat waves and wildfires are becoming more common.[5] Increased warming in the Arctic has contributed to melting permafrost, glacial retreat and sea ice loss.[6] Higher temperatures are also causing more intense storms, droughts, and other weather extremes.[7] Rapid environmental change in mountains, coral reefs, and the Arctic is forcing many species to relocate or become extinct.[8] Even if efforts to minimise future warming are successful, some effects will continue for centuries.\nThought 2: The observation says that it is expected to shrink glaciers, so it is true.\nAction 2: Finish[SUPPORTS]\nObservation 2: Episode finished, reward = 1\n\n", "\nDetermine if there is Observation that SUPPORTS or REFUTES a Claim, or if there is NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION. \nClaim: Nikolaj Coster-Waldau worked with the Fox Broadcasting Company.\nThought 1: I need to search Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and find if he has worked with the Fox Broadcasting Company.\nAction 1: Search[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]\nObservation 1: Nikolaj William Coster-Waldau (born 27 July 1970) is a Danish actor and producer.

It also affected modern British popular culture significantly through its books concerning politics, the arts, and science.[6]. Penguin Books is now an imprint of the worldwide Penguin Random House, a conglomerate formed in 2013 by its merger with American publisher Random House, a subsidiary of German media conglomerate Bertelsmann.[7] Formerly, Penguin Group was wholly owned by British Pearson plc, the global media company which also owned the Financial Times.[8] When Penguin Random House was formed, Pearson had a 47% stake in the new company, which was reduced to 25% in July 2017.

The event caused the extinction of all non-avian dinosaurs.

In the geologic record, the K\u2013Pg event is marked by a thin layer of sediment called the K\u2013Pg boundary, which can be found throughout the world in marine and terrestrial rocks.

Mogadishu has a long history, which ranges from the ancient period up until the present, serving as the capital of the Sultanate of Mogadishu in the 9th-13th century, which for many centuries controlled the Indian Ocean gold trade, and eventually came under the Ajuran Empire in the 13th century which was an important player in the medieval Silk Road maritime trade. Mogadishu enjoyed the height of its prosperity during the 14th and 15th centuries[10]  and was during the early modern period considered the wealthiest city on the East African coast, as well as the center of a thriving textile industry.[11] In the 17th century, Mogadishu and parts of southern Somalia fell under the Hiraab Imamate and in the 19th century came under the Geledi Sultanate's sphere of influence.. In 1894 the Somali chiefs on behalf of Mogadishu had signed a treaty of peace, friendship and protection with Filonardi of the Italian Benadir Company.[12][13][14] The onset of Italian colonialism occurred in stages, with Italian treaties signed in the 1880s followed by economic engagement between Somali clans and the Italian Benadir Company and then direct governance by the Italian government after 1906, British Military Administration of Somalia after World War II and the UN Italian Trust Territory in the 1950s.\nThought 2: It says that there is a capital called Mogadishu, but it does not say if it is in Somalia.\nAction 2: Search[Somalia]\nObservation 2: Coordinates: 10\u00b0N 49\u00b0E\ufeff / \ufeff10\u00b0N 49\u00b0E\ufeff / 10; 49.

The UN Charter mandates the UN and its member states to maintain international peace and security, uphold international law, achieve \"higher standards of living\" for their citizens, address \"economic, social, health, and related problems\", and promote \"universal respect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion\".[2] As a charter and constituent treaty, its rules and obligations are binding on all members and supersede those of other treaties.[1][3]. During the Second World War, the Allies\u2014formally known as the United Nations\u2014agreed to establish a new postwar international organization.[4] Pursuant to this goal, the UN Charter was discussed, prepared, and drafted during the San Francisco Conference that began 25 April 1945, which involved most of the world's sovereign nations.[5] Following two-thirds approval of each part, the final text was unanimously adopted by delegates and opened for signature on 26 June 1945;[6][7] it was signed in San Francisco, United States, by 50 of the 51 original member countries.[6][Note 1].

He has been a senator for Florence since 2018.[1] Renzi has served as the leader of Italia Viva (IV) since 2019,[2] having been the secretary of the Democratic Party (PD) from 2013 to 2018,[3] with a brief interruption in 2017.[4]. After serving as the president of the province of Florence from 2004 to 2009 and the mayor of Florence from 2009 to 2014,[5] Renzi was elected secretary of the PD in 2013, becoming Prime Minister the following year.[6] At the age of 39 years, Renzi, who was at the time the youngest leader in the G7 and also the first-serving mayor to become Prime Minister, became the youngest person to have served as Prime Minister.[7] While in power, Renzi's government implemented numerous reforms, including changes to the Italian electoral law, a relaxation of labour and employment laws with the intention of boosting economic growth,[8] a thorough reformation of the public administration, the simplification of civil trials, the introduction of same-sex civil unions,[9] and the abolition of many small taxes.[10]. After the rejection of his constitutional reform in the 2016 Italian constitutional referendum,[11][12] Renzi formally resigned as Prime Minister on 12 December; his Foreign Minister Paolo Gentiloni was appointed his replacement.[13][14] He resigned as secretary of the PD following defeat in the 2018 Italian general election.[15] In September 2019, he left the PD and founded the Italia Viva party.[16] In January 2021, Renzi revoked his party's support to the Conte II Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, which brought down the government and resulted in the 2021 Italian government crisis.[17] In February 2021, Renzi's IV supported Prime Minister Mario Draghi's national unity government.[18] Renzi has been described as a centrist and as a liberal by political observers.[19][20][21].

Originally named Gaius Octavius, he was born into an old and wealthy equestrian branch of the plebeian gens Octavia. His maternal great-uncle Julius Caesar was assassinated in 44 BC, and Octavius was named in Caesar's will as his adopted son and heir; as a result, he inherited Caesar's name, estate, and the loyalty of his legions.

Typical of the genre, the film tells the story of a woman who advocates female independence in combat with a lothario; the plot reflects the attitudes and behaviour of the early pre-sexual revolution 1960s but has an anachronistic conclusion driven by more modern, post-feminist ideas and attitudes. Though the film received a mixed critical response at the time of release and underperformed at the box office, it has since undergone a critical reappraisal and grown a cult following for its subversion of rom-com conventions.[7].

To handle this efficiently, Xatrix was transferred to a new corporation under Markham as creative director.[3] With the assistance of Activision, Gray Matter Studios was established on June 17, 1999, and took over most of the former employees.[4][5] Activision initially owned 40% of the studio.[6] It bought the remaining 60% in January 2002, after the successful release of Return to Castle Wolfenstein.[2][7] The publisher paid 133,690 shares of common stock, at the time worth around US$3.2\u00a0million.[7] Post-acquisition, the studio was put to work on the Call of Duty: United Offensive expansion.[8] It also worked on Trinity: The Shatter Effect, which was announced and then canceled in late 2003.[9] In 2005, during the development of Call of Duty 2: Big Red One, Gray Matter Studios was merged into Activision's Treyarch studio.\nThought 3: It says that Gray Matter Studios was a top rated game developer, but it does not say if it was a top rated game developer in 2003.\nAction 3: Finish[NOT ENOUGH INFO]\nObservation 3: Episode finished, reward = 1\n\n", "\nDetermine if there is Observation that SUPPORTS or REFUTES a Claim, or if there is NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION. \nClaim: Nikolaj Coster-Waldau worked with the Fox Broadcasting Company.\nThought 1: I need to search Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and find if he has worked with the Fox Broadcasting Company.\nAction 1: Search[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]\nObservation 1: Nikolaj William Coster-Waldau (born 27 July 1970) is a Danish actor and producer.

The film also stars Kelly Macdonald as Moss's wife Carla Jean, and Woody Harrelson as a bounty hunter seeking Moss and the return of the $2 million.. No Country for Old Men premiered in competition at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival on May 19.[4] The film became a commercial success, grossing $171 million worldwide against the budget of $25 million. Critics praised the Coens' direction and screenplay and Bardem's performance, and the film won 76 awards from 109 nominations from multiple organizations; it won four awards at the 80th Academy Awards (including Best Picture), three British Academy Film Awards (BAFTAs), and two Golden Globes.[5] The American Film Institute listed it as an AFI Movie of the Year,[6] and the National Board of Review selected it as the best of 2007.[7].

Although it was grouped among the comedies,[1] many modern editors have relabelled the play as one of Shakespeare's late romances. Some critics consider it to be one of Shakespeare's \"problem plays\" because the first three acts are filled with intense psychological drama, while the last two acts are comic and supply a happy ending.[2]. The play has been intermittently popular, revived in productions in various forms and adaptations by some of the leading theatre practitioners in Shakespearean performance history, beginning after a long interval with David Garrick in his adaptation Florizel and Perdita (first performed in 1753 and published in 1756).

The genre was influential in Britain in shaping politics, national policies, and popular perceptions in the years leading up to the First World War, and remains a part of popular culture to this day. Several of the books were written by or ghostwritten for military officers and experts of the day who believed that the nation would be saved if the particular tactic that they favoured was or would be adopted.[2].

Herculaneum was buried under volcanic ash and pumice in the Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD.. Like the nearby city of Pompeii, Herculaneum is famous as one of the few ancient cities to be preserved nearly intact, as the ash that blanketed the town protected it against looting and the elements. Although less known than Pompeii today, it was the first and, for a long time, the only discovered Vesuvian city (in 1709). Pompeii was revealed in 1748 and identified in 1763.[1] Unlike Pompeii, the mainly pyroclastic material that covered Herculaneum carbonized and preserved more wooden objects such as roofs, beds, and doors, as well as other organic-based materials such as food and papyrus..\nThought 2: The observation says that Herculaneum is near Naples, so it is not near Pompeii.\nAction 2: Finish[REFUTES]\nObservation 2: Episode finished, reward = 0\n\n", "\nDetermine if there is Observation that SUPPORTS or REFUTES a Claim, or if there is NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION. \nClaim: Nikolaj Coster-Waldau worked with the Fox Broadcasting Company.\nThought 1: I need to search Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and find if he has worked with the Fox Broadcasting Company.\nAction 1: Search[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]\nObservation 1: Nikolaj William Coster-Waldau (born 27 July 1970) is a Danish actor and producer.

Interpretations of the song vary widely. Frederick Douglass wrote in his 1855 autobiography My Bondage and My Freedom that the song \"awakens sympathies for the slave, in which antislavery principles take root, grow, and flourish\".[5][6] However, the song's publication by Firth & Pond as a minstrel song and its use in \"Tom shows\" (stagings of Stowe's novel of varying degrees of sincerity and faithfulness to the original text), and other settings, have clouded its reception.[2][3]. The creation of the song \"My Old Kentucky Home, Good-Night!\" established a decisive moment within Stephen Foster's career in regard to his personal beliefs on the institution of slavery as following the publishing of the song, Foster began to abandon minstrelsy and writing music with African-American vernacular.[7] It also is an example of the common theme of the loss of home, which is prevalent throughout Foster's work.\nThought 2: The song is about a slave who is leaving his home, so it is not the destroyer of Kentucky.\nAction 2: Finish[REFUTES]\nObservation 2: Episode finished, reward = 0\n\n", "\nDetermine if there is Observation that SUPPORTS or REFUTES a Claim, or if there is NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION. \nClaim: Nikolaj Coster-Waldau worked with the Fox Broadcasting Company.\nThought 1: I need to search Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and find if he has worked with the Fox Broadcasting Company.\nAction 1: Search[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]\nObservation 1: Nikolaj William Coster-Waldau (born 27 July 1970) is a Danish actor and producer.

In pre-Olympian Bronze Age Greece, Poseidon was venerated as a chief deity at Pylos and Thebes, with the cult title \"earth shaker\";[2] in the myths of isolated Arcadia, he is related to Demeter and Persephone and was venerated as a horse, and as a god of the waters.[3] Poseidon maintained both associations among most Greeks: He was regarded as the tamer or father of horses,[2] who, with a strike of his trident, created springs (in the Greek language, the terms for both are related).[4] His Roman equivalent is Neptune.. Homer and Hesiod suggest that Poseidon became lord of the sea when, following the overthrow of his father Cronus, the world was divided by lot among Cronus' three sons; Zeus was given the sky, Hades the underworld, and Poseidon the sea, with the Earth and Mount Olympus belonging to all three.[2][5] In Homer's Iliad, Poseidon supports the Greeks against the Trojans during the Trojan War; in the Odyssey, during the sea-voyage from Troy back home to Ithaca, the Greek hero Odysseus provokes Poseidon's fury by blinding his son, the Cyclops Polyphemus, resulting in Poseidon punishing him with storms, causing the complete loss of his ship and companions, and delaying his return by ten years. Poseidon is also the subject of a Homeric hymn.
